Task 1:

For large side lengths (L ≥ 5), the estimated number of clusters matches the true value for 
all tested dimensions. This indicates that the method correctly identifies all clusters
when they are well separated. As side length decreases, the estimated number of 
clusters abruptly drops to one. This shows that once clusters begin to overlap, the 
algorithm interprets the data as a single group. This transition occurs at larger 
side lengths for higher dimensions—around L ≈ 4 for n = 6, L ≈ 3 for n = 5, and L ≈ 2 
for n = 3–4. This phenomenon highlights that distinguishing clusters becomes more difficult as 
dimensionality increases.

Task 2:

As max radius decreases, the shells move closer together. This casues points from adjacent shells to 
fall within the same distance threshold. When this happens, the adjacency graph becomes increasingly 
connected across shells, and spectral clustering can no longer distinguish them as separate groups. 
If a smaller d_threshold is used, the algorithm would tolerate closer shells. This might shiftthe failure 
point to smaller radii. Conversely, a larger d_threshold would cause failure at larger radii.
