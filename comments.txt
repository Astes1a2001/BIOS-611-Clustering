Task 1:

For large side lengths (L ≥ 5), the estimated number of clusters matches the true value for 
all tested dimensions. This indicates that the method correctly identifies all clusters
when they are well separated. As side length decreases, the estimated number of 
clusters abruptly drops to one. This shows that once clusters begin to overlap, the 
algorithm interprets the data as a single group. This transition occurs at larger 
side lengths for higher dimensions—around L ≈ 4 for n = 6, L ≈ 3 for n = 5, and L ≈ 2 
for n = 3–4. This phenomenon highlights that distinguishing clusters becomes more difficult as 
dimensionality increases.
